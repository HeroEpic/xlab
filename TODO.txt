In need of overhaul:
    * particles
    * md2
    * cam
    * render buffer / effects
    * poly clipper
    * draw
    * obj
    * wav
    * ... pretty much everything

work on:
    * me mp3
    * ...

TODO:
    * make all text same size, get scale factor and multiply, use pixel sizes
        as input so any size will be the same on the PSP with same input
    * change md2 to use vertex buffer, no display list memory crap
    * put slice blitter in xgraphics.h to be used elsewhere
