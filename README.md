xlab is a library/engine for making PSP games and apps.
It was used to create [Battlegrounds 3](https://github.com/xfacter/battlegrounds3) and [Battlegrounds 2](https://github.com/xfacter/battlegrounds2).

This repo contains the latest code from BG3 with some fixes,
some leftover tools from BG2,
and some experiments not used in the games.
A sample project is included which shows the basic usage,
demonstrating rendering, textures, fonts, and animated MD2 models.
